# OpenNext Starter

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Read the documentation at https://opennext.js.org/cloudflare.

## Develop

Run the Next.js development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or similar package manager command
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Preview

Preview the application locally on the Cloudflare runtime:

```bash
npm run preview
# or similar package manager command
```

## Deploy

Deploy the application to Cloudflare:

```bash
npm run deploy
# or similar package manager command
```

## GitHub Actions (Deploy to Workers)

This repo includes a GitHub Actions workflow that deploys to Cloudflare Workers on `push` to `main`.

Required repository secrets (GitHub → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions):

- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`
- `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`

Notes:

- The Worker name is configured in `wrangler.jsonc` as `lldc`.
- The workflow runs `pnpm run deploy` (OpenNext build + Wrangler deploy).
